# Untangle
DOUBTS AND GRIEVANCE SOLVER

PROBLEMS WE ARE FACING CURRENTLY :

>> Students, usually have doubts and grievances,official or personal, regarding academics, housing, courses and much more, which are sometimes left unentertained
>> No correct platform to put forth students's problems and get their solutions readily and quickly!
>> No platform where  announcements can be made easily and instantly
>> The seniors here are really helpful, but there is no such common platform where they can address the problems of their juniors who are completely unknown to them


SOLUTION TO THSESE PROBLEMS:

>> aims at providing a common platform to our college for the addressing doubts and grievances of students
>> enable the students to directly and easily get all their doubts and grievances clarified anywhere, anytime
>> help to bridge the gap between the administration and student body
>> aid in reducing the redundant doubtsand addressing them only once , thus saving time

FUNCTIONALITY OF THE APP:

>> Untangle will allow students to register only from their college email id’s
>> The students will be able to post their doubts and grievances easily either privately (only visible to them and the admin) or publicly
>>  posts would easily be filtered with the help of several filters
>> Comments section in every post would allow the other students to help as well and communicate about the problem on a common platform thereby quickening the process of      solution finding
>> Their posts will display a Status option which can only be changed by the admin
>> The college administration will be able to login into the app using their respective college email ids and a common password
>> The admin will also be able tomake announcements
>> The administration will have the sole right of changing the status of various posts and updating the students about their grievances
>> To ensure the validation of the posts, the admin will be able to view the details of every student posting his/her grievance
>> Just like the Admin the clubs will also be able to make announcements
>> To provide a personalized experience the app will allow the users to star the posts, they consider to be important,and view them separately. 

       !!Thus,this app would help in the efficient working of the college!!
